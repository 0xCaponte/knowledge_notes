# Basics of Personal Branding

Personal branding is the combination of skills, experiences, and personality that we showcase to the world.

**It is NOT what we say it is, but what the people receive and say it is. Self-promotion is NOT personal branding.**

## Why we do personal branding?
- Build a public image and reputation
- Become thought leaders or have a clear voice in our sector
- Share knowledge and provide value to our sector

## Benefits of a Personal Brand:
- Helps establish your presence and authority in the sector
- Acts as proof of your skills and knowledge
- Forces you to be up-to-date in the field
- Creates networking opportunities and increases your surface area of luck

## How to define our Personal brand?

1) Values
    - What guides your professional decisions?
    - What do you stand for in your field?

2) Objectives
    - Why are you doing this?
    - What do you want to achieve or get from your brand in the short and long term?
    
    Depending on the answer you can define your Target audience, platform, and approach. Not everyone hangs out in the same place or cares about the same stuffs.

3) SWOT Analysis
    - Strengths → what unique expertise or perspective do you have?
    - Weakness → where could you improve?
    - Opportunities → what needs of the sector align with your strengths?
    - Threats → what obstacles/challenges do you or the sector face?

	All 4 of these are areas you can work with or on, and talk to your audience about it.

4) Brand Statement

    With your previous answers reflect on:

    - Who are you?
    - What is the expertise you bring to the table?
    - What value you provide the community?

## General Advice:

1. **Look for the leaders:** the people in your sector that drive the conversation, you might already have them as a reference, or you might not know about them, yet. See their brands and their actions, take what works for you. Ask:

   - What do you like/dislike from their approach?
   - What seems to work for them and why?
   - Where do they hang-out?

2. **Be Authentic:** don't show something you are not. You are showing only a part of you, but serious inconsistencies between what you share and what you are will eventually damage your brand.

3. **Be focused:** don't confuse your audience by talking about 10 different things, focus what you share to your main topic. At least, 80% of the time.

4. **Have Quality:** make sure that what you put out there, be it: content, ideas, your logo, your image, anything; all is coherent and not sloppy. You want to transmit seriousness, reliability and quality. Be trustworthy.

5. **Network:** have real and meaningful interactions, with as many people in the sector as you can, make sure you are providing value in some way.
