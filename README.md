# ðŸ§  My Knowledge Notes

A collection of my notes on things I'm learning. These notes aim to be simple, clear, and visual, following the Feynman technique: if you canâ€™t explain it clearly, you donâ€™t understand it well enough (I'm still working on this)

##  Topics

### ðŸ›  Format & Style

- **Feynman Technique**: Explain as if to a beginner.
- **Visual-first**: Diagrams and images where they add clarity.
- **No fluff**: Short, useful, to the point.
- **Stamped**: Most notes have their source and creation date for tracking.
- **Handwritten notes**: I will try to upload both my original scans of my handwritten notes and a Markdown version.
- **Spelling errors**: Iâ€™m human and not a native English speaker, so there might be some spelling errors, especially in the handwritten notes. Apologies for that, and feel free to point them out!
